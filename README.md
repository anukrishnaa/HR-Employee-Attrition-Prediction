# HR-Employee-Attrition-Prediction

The HR Employee Attrition Prediction project aims to help organizations identify which employees are likely to leave, so they can take steps to improve retention. By analyzing a dataset with information about 1,470 employees, including factors like job role, performance, and satisfaction, we developed models to predict employee attrition. This project focuses on providing HR teams with insights that can guide their retention strategies.

We explored several machine learning models, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and a model combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Logistic Regression. The PCA + Logistic Regression model emerged as the most effective, delivering the highest accuracy in predicting which employees might leave, making it a valuable tool for HR departments.

Overall, this project shows how machine learning can be used to predict employee turnover, offering actionable insights for improving employee retention. By implementing these predictive models, companies can proactively address potential attrition, helping to maintain a stable and committed workforce.
